Pazhumpori

We begin making the Kerala Pazham Pori Recipe (Banana Fritters Recipe) by prepping all the ingredients and keeping them ready.

First step is to make the batter.

In a mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, maida, baking soda, salt, turmeric powder, cardamom powder and sugar. Stir well to combine.

Add little water at a time and make a thick batter such that it smoothly coats the back of the spoon. 

Next, cut the banana into thin long stripes and keep aside.

Heat the oil in a kadai for deep frying and keep it ready.

Once the oil is hot, dip the banana slices in the batter until well coated and carefully slide it into the hot oil.

Deep fry the Kerala Pazham Pori till it is golden brown and crisp on both sides.

Drain the Kerala Pazham Pori from the oil and place it on a kitchen paper napkin to drain excess oil and serve hot.ï»¿
